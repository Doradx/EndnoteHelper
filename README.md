Click the right button of your mouse, and check if the service is running?

Just enjoy your self if the service is running now!

Open EndNote to see if the related PDF has been attached to the reference.

## How to find the searching recordï¼Ÿ
The task list will show all the papers which don't have attachment now, and all of their state will be shown in this window.

## The service is running, but the Task View (Reference List) is empty and nothing has changed?

**Please run the toolbox before you start EndNote program, then open EndNote after this toolbox is running correctly. **

Because the database will be locked when EndNote is running.
